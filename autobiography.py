    "My name is Reina Luz B. Empleo. I was born on November 12, 1999, in a house in Punta Princesa, Tres de Abril Street."
    " Located in Cebu City. I grew up in a sheltered environment, given that I was mostly sick and the only daughter in my family."
    
    "\n\nI have always been a curious-minded person who loves puzzle, simulation, educational and investigation games which fueled my curiosity in computers."
    " I would mess with flash games or with some softwares in my old family PC."
    " Ever since then, I always had an easier time to learn applications and various software. This interest led me to take STEM strand in SHS."
 
    "\n\nI attended Cebu Institute of Technology - University, where I grew to be a more knowledgeable person on science and technology. I learned a lot of things during that time, such as leadership and how to deal with people."
    " My hardwork and dedication paid off and earned me a 'with Honors' medal, also a slight one semester tuition discount when I went to college."
    
    "\n\nStill attending the same University, I pursued a degree in Computer Science first. However it was the height of COVID-19, and the online setting greatly effected my mental health."
    " Personally, I did my worse at school during those years. So in the end of 2nd year, I shifted to Information Technology. And my years in IT had the most transformative experiences for me."
    " Personally, mentally and academically. I had made projects and groupworks with such innovative people under the supervisory of esteemed professors, developing lifelong friendships with some of them."

    "\n\n Currently, I'm a 4th year IT student, in my last semester before I graduate. I'm looking for an internship that would build a solid foundation for the start of my career."
    " I've grown to be a better person than I was when I started college. That I grew out of my comfort zone and, I'm actively pursuing a career in Cybersecurity, hoping to be a SOC analyst or a Digital Forensics Examiner."
    "\n\nI never really thought I'd reach this far :>"
